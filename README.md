# Flu-Prediction

This project aims to analyze the behavior of machine learning algorithms in the prediction of the influenza virus. From this analysis, conclude which is the best algorithm to make this type of prediction.

## Description

To maintain vaccine efficiency, effective prediction models are needed. For this reason, this project proposes to apply machine learning techniques to detect possible sequences of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins present in the H1N1 and H3N2 variants of the influenza virus. In this way, it is possible to have one more tool for detecting new strains, making the production of vaccines faster and more efficient. This project is part of my final thesis to obtain a degree in computer science at the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia.
